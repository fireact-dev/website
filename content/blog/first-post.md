## Introducing fireact.dev

We're excited to announce fireact.dev, an open-source framework designed to help developers build production-ready SaaS applications quickly and efficiently. Built with Firebase, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Stripe integration, fireact.dev provides everything you need to launch your SaaS product.

### Why We Built fireact.dev

Building a SaaS application from scratch involves implementing many common features - authentication, subscription management, team collaboration, billing, and more. We created fireact.dev to provide a solid foundation for these features, allowing developers to focus on their unique business logic instead of reinventing the wheel.

### Key Features

#### Authentication & User Management
- Complete authentication system with sign-up, sign-in, and password reset
- User profile management
- Role-based access control
- Team member invitations and permissions

#### Subscription Management
- Multiple subscription plans support
- Stripe integration for payment processing
- Billing portal and invoice management
- Payment method management
- Subscription upgrades and downgrades

#### Developer Experience
- TypeScript for better code quality
- TailwindCSS for responsive design
- Firebase emulator support for local development
- Comprehensive documentation
- Modular architecture

### Modular Architecture

fireact.dev is built with modularity in mind. The framework consists of three main packages:

1. **@fireact.dev/core**: Essential authentication and user management features
2. **@fireact.dev/saas**: Subscription management and billing capabilities
3. **@fireact.dev/saas-cloud-functions**: Backend processing and Stripe integration

This modular approach allows you to start with basic authentication features and progressively add SaaS capabilities as your application grows.
